`nProblem BackgroundÂ `nThe healthcare sector in South Africa operates as a crucial service supply chain. The quality of care depends on the coordinated flow of patients, staff, medical equipment, information and resources across different facilities.Â `nPublic hospitals in particular play the vital role of service providers for around 84% of the South African population, as most people cannot afford private healthcare (Ramaphosa, 2024). Thanks to this, the quality of healthcare one receives is determined by oneâ€™s ability to pay. Public hospitals must not only deliver direct medical services but also manage the flow of patients between clinics, emergency rooms, and care centres.Â `nWithin the healthcare supply chain, patient intake and hospital accessibility are of utmost importance. This process involves taking a patient into care, identifying their healthcare needs, and directing them to the appropriate level of care. The efficiency of this process has a direct impact on the quality of service delivery. If any of these processes were to experience delays or misallocations, it could lead to patient build-ups, costly waiting times that compromise patient outcomes, and underutilization.Â Â `nSome of the current problems and inefficiencies public hospitals face are:Â `nShortage of beds: The World Health Organisation recommends 5 beds per 1000 individuals, public hospitals are currently at 1.8 beds per 1000 individualsÂ Â Â Â Â Â  (Nedbank.co.za, 2022).Â `nÂ `nProject objectivesÂ `nThis project is looking to develop a web-based platform that improves inefficiencies and solves the difficulty in accessibility in the public healthcare system. The objectives are:Â `nTo allow patients to look up what medicine is available at nearby clinics and hospitals.Â `nProvide up to date information on hospital and clinic capacity, bed availability and wait times.Â `nEnable patients to locate the closest hospital or clinic with the relevant doctors and medicine a patient need.Â `nNotify patients when medicine is restocked or a needed service are available.Â `nCreate a low data basic mobile platform to ensure all patients have access to this service.Â `nÂ `nAll the objectives focus on the attempt to help patients get better healthcare. Secondly it is to help the system to have a better flow and have less bottlenecks.Â `nSolution FrameworkÂ `nThe proposed solution is an online platform that is free and open to all citizens of South Africa. The platform will be interactive and allow patients real time information.Â `nKey features:Â `nA login with South African ID number and details to speed up the admin portion of work at hospitals and allow patients to get help sooner.Â `nInformation on medicine stock at each hospital via the web pages informational/search section.Â `nService availability like bed availability and doctors on duty at each hospital will be a part of the informational/search section of the platform.Â `nClosest Hospital/Clinic to a patient based on time and distance. Link with google maps using their location.Â `nAlerts and notifications via SMS or email based on availability of booked needs using the patientâ€™s information provided on login.Â `nSystem cohesion Â `nHealthcare facilities update the availability of their service and stock through basic input interfaces that already exist we will be connected to those systems.Â `nData is centralised to the department of Health server.Â `nPatients can access the system with mobile phones, tablets or computers.Â `nFeedback is open to the public on improvements and need they desire.Â `nThis design ensures a feedback loop between facilities and the public, creating transparency and trust in the healthcare system.Â `nExpected Impact &amp; Sustainability Â `nEskom se push template.Â `nBenefitsÂ `nReduce unnecessary travel for patients saving them time and money.Â `nDecrease the crowd sizes and queue lengths at hospitals and clinics by allocating patients to facilities more efficiently.Â `nImproved patient satisfaction by being more open with information.Â `nMore efficient operations in healthcare due to patient readiness and â€œthrottlingâ€, â€œkanbanâ€.Â `nSave more livesÂ `nSustainability Â Â `nKeep it basic and scalable for all provinces.Â `nLow cost easy to use, by leveraging the current system and making it more efficient without the need of high capital.Â `nLow maintenance system, a basic informative web platform that doesnâ€™t require too much digital maintenance.Â `nLooking at the future and creating possibility with integration into eHealth for healthcare information that does not need on hand treatment.Â `nÂ `nReferencesÂ `nRamaphosa, C.
